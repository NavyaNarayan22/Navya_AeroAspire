 Basic HTML Page Assignment

 Overview
This project is a simple HTML page created as part of my internship assignment for AeroAspire. The page includes **About**, **Photo**, and **Contact** sections, styled using CSS with layout managed by Flexbox and Grid. The goal was to practice semantic HTML, CSS layout, and responsive design.

 Features
- **Header**: Displays the page title "INTRODUCTION".
- **About Section**: Brief introduction about myself.
- **Photo Section**: Displays a photo and links to [AeroAspire](https://aeroaspire.in/).
- **Contact Section**: Shows contact number and email link.
- **Footer**: Contains my name and copyright info.
- **CSS Styling**: Uses Flexbox/Grid for layout, custom colors, borders, and box shadows.
