# JavaScript Interactive Features Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts by building an interactive web page. It covers variables, DOM selection, event handling, forms, and DOM manipulation. The page includes a dynamic greeting based on the current time, a button to show/hide a section, and a form that displays user input without reloading the page.

## Features
- **Greeting Based on Time:** Shows a personalized greeting ("Good morning", "Good afternoon", etc.) depending on the user's current time.
- **Show/Hide Section:** A button toggles the visibility of a specific section on the page.
- **Interactive Form:**
  - Collects user's name and email.
  - Validates input (checks for empty fields and valid email format).
  - On submit, displays the entered data on the page without refreshing.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for styling
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for interactivity

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Try out the greeting, toggle button, and form features.
